# COÂ² Dashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6
and is based on the following components:

## Angular 11

```cmd
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new --routing --skip-tests --style=scss dashboard
```

**Hint** Do not enable strict checks as this leads to compile errors with echarts@5.0.0 (which are fixed in RC of 5.0.1).

cd dashboard
ng add ngx-tailwind
```
